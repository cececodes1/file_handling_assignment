1. Exploring Python's OS Module


Task 1: Directory Inspector:

Problem Statement: Create a Python script that lists all files and subdirectories in a given directory. Your script should prompt the user for the directory path and then display the contents.

Code Example:
    import os

    def list_directory_contents(path):
        # List and print all files and subdirectories in the given path
Expected Outcome: The script should correctly list all files and subdirectories in the specified directory. Handle exceptions for invalid paths or inaccessible directories.
